    <h1>Gamer Tags</h1>
    <h2>Importance</h2>
        <p>Gamer Tags are the unique set of characters that identifies a player,
          especially in a multiplayer environment, although they also have their uses in
          a single player environment. Webpages require unique identifiers
          in order to login and games are no different. <strong>However, certain <em>unwritten</em>
          rules apply to gamer tags.</strong><br><br>
          While it is common practice to use a person's email adress or real name
          as a username on webpages, gamer tags are usually not connected to the actual person
          in any identifiable way. However, <em>people may become known more through
          their gamer tag in the online world than through their actual names</em>. <br><br>
          This is why choosing a proper gamer tag is especially important.
          </p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>Here, I will analyze three gamer tags of my friends.</p>
        <h3>Beaver von Hüpfburg</h3>
        <p>My own gamer tag is <em>Beaver von Hüpfburg</em>. The journey by which I have come
          to identify by this name is long. I originally played under the name Soul Reaver.
          There was a respected member of the Warcraft modding community by the same name and
          so I have decided to change my name to Soul Beaver.<br><br>
          However, friends began to mostly refer to me simply as Beaver and so the Soul was
          consequently dropped. <br><br>
          Around the time I became a staunch monarchist and a fan of Austria-Hungary, I became
          fascinated with the german tradition of writing noble's names with the word von, eg.
          Habsburg Otto would be written as Otto von Habsburg. <br><br>
          The final part of my name is an attempt to take the edge of a self-given noble name,
          and at the same time play on the joke even more. Burg gives the name a noble ring,
          even though Hüpfburg means bouncy castle.
        <h3>Harlond</h3>
        <p><em>Harlond</em> is a river in the Lord of the Rings series and is the gamer tag
          of one of my oldest online friend. He has been playing with me and my brother since
          I was 12.<br><br>
          Harlond is a typical example of a gamer tag born out of a word that catches the person's
          fancy and becomes disassociated from the original word and becomes associated with the player
          instead.
        </p>
        <h3>Fail Elek</h3>
        <p><em>FailElek</em> is the gamer tag of my brother. It is a hungarian wordplay. The words read together means to fail,
        while Elek is a hungarian given name, therefore the name can be understood as surname Fail, given name
      Elek. </p>
