    <h1>Gamer Tags</h1>
    <h2>Importance</h2>
        <p>Gamer Tags are the unique set of characters that identifies a player,
          especially in a multiplayer environment, although they also have their uses in
          a single player environment. Webpages require unique identifiers
          in order to login and games are no different. <strong>However, certain <em>unwritten</em>
          rules apply to gamer tags.</strong><br><br>
          While it is common practice to use a person's email adress or real name
          as a username on webpages, gamer tags are usually not connected to the actual person
          in any identifiable way. However, <em>people may become known more through
          their gamer tag in the online world than through their actual names</em>. <br><br>
          This is why choosing a proper gamer tag is especially important.
          </p>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
        <p>Here, I will analyze three gamer tags of my friends.</p>
        <h3>Beaver von Hüpfburg</h3>
        <p>My own gamer tag is <em>Beaver von Hüpfburg</em>. The journey by which I have come
          to identify by this name is long. I originally played under the name Soul Reaver.
          There was a respected member of the Warcraft modding community by the same name and
          so I have decided to change my name to Soul Beaver.<br><br>
          However, friends began to mostly refer to me simply as Beaver and so the Soul was
          consequently dropped. <br><br>
          Around the time I became a staunch monarchist and a fan of Austria-Hungary, I became
          fascinated with the german tradition of writing noble's names with the word von, eg.
          Habsburg Otto would be written as Otto von Habsburg. <br><br>
          The final part of my name is an attempt to take the edge of a self-given noble name,
          and at the same time play on the joke even more. Burg gives the name a noble ring,
          even though Hüpfburg means bouncy castle.
        <h3>Harlond</h3>
        <p><em>Harlond</em> is a river in the Lord of the Rings series and is the gamer tag
          of one of my oldest online friend. He has been playing with me and my brother since
          I was 12.<br><br>
          Harlond is a typical example of a gamer tag born out of a word that catches the person's
          fancy and becomes disassociated from the original word and becomes associated with the player
          instead.
        </p>
        <h3>Fail Elek</h3>
        <p><em>FailElek</em> is the gamer tag of my brother. It is a hungarian wordplay. The words read together means to fail,
        while Elek is a hungarian given name, therefore the name can be understood as surname Fail, given name
      Elek. </p>
    <h2>Choosing your own gamer tag</h2>
    <p>As you can see by now, a gamer tag is the virtual representation of the person in the gaming community. Therefore,
      choosing your gamer tag deserves at least a few minutes of planning. Take these tips into consideration when choosing
      your own:
      <ul>
        <li>The short will end up being used, by wary of this.</li>
        <p>Long usernames tend to get shortened to a just a few characters for quicker communication. At most two syllables are
          what you can realistically expect people to still say or type out. For example, despite the long form of my name, I am still
          mostly referred to as Beaver. This means that whatever your gamer tag is, plan ahead and guess what it will be shortened to.</p>
        <li>The rest is for you.</li>
        <p>The rest of your name will appear but will never be typed. People will still read it though! These is a perfect space to convey
          personality.</p>
        <li>Avoid obscenities!</li>
        <p>Many players may include obscene words in their gamer tags. This is counterproductive, especially in team games.</p>
      </ul>
